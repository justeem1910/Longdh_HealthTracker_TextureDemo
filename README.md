I. Texture
Texture is an iOS framework built on top of UIKit that keeps even the most complex user interfaces smooth and responsive. It was originally built to make Facebook's Paper possible, and goes hand-in-hand with pop's physics-based animations â€” but it's just as powerful with UIKit Dynamics and conventional app designs.
